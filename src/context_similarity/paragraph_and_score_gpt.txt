COMP8851 Final Report Name: Arunabh Mukherjee Student ID: 46310290 Session: Session 2, 2022 Organization: Truuth Submitted on: 4 November 2022 Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia Internship Report (Final)Page  of 140Acknowledgement Every moment of my final semester has been made richer through the kindness and support of multiple individuals. Some of them are acknowledged below. First, I would like to thank my parents for their financial support and encouragement they provide me everyday. Their support helped me adapt to a new city and country, when I was alone and especially through the hard months of the pandemic. Second, I would like to thank the CEO of Truuth, Mr Mike Simpson, for giving me the opportunity to work as an intern on an exciting project, my supervisor and Truuth’s lead data scientist, Ms Matineh Poushide, for her constant guidance on my work and helping me plan the work goal every week, and members of the Liveness team, Ms Le Nga Ho and Ms Jennifer Box for their collaboration and their help in achieving weekly goals.  Third, I would like to acknowledge every one of my professors and tutors at Macquarie University, without whom I would not have developed my knowledge of data science. I would especially like to acknowledge Dr Amin Beheshti for his role in setting up this partnership with industry, which allowed us a streamlined path to apply for internships. Finally, I would like to thank my girlfriend Kylie, for her support and allowing me to use her as a sounding board whenever I encountered a difficult problem. Without her help, I would not have reached this stage of my Master's degree, let alone through till the end of my internship.

Mike worked as in management consulting as a partner with McKinsey & Company, and then as a senior executive at Telstra. Nick was Chief of Operations at Virgin Mobile in Australia and South Africa. During their time together at Telstra, they realised that Telstra lacked a digital identity system for their customers and employees. To address this gap in identity identity and authentication management, Mike and Nick founded Truuth. Introduction of the organisation Truuth has grown since its founding through 2020 with 15 full time employees and 10 contractors. Most of the employees are technical architects and developers lead by Mr Mehdi Soltany, the Chief Technical Officer of Truuth. Truuth is currently developing and maintains the following products: 1.Truuth KYC (Know Your Customer), which performs several checks based on thorough tests of ‘liveness’ using multi-factor biometric authentication, i.e face, voice and fingerprint. It also uses device sensors to defeat deepfake presentation attacks. Truuth KYC currently has two enterprise customers. 2.Truuth Verify performs multiple authenticity checks on identity documents to detect falsified documents using holograms, watermarks, microprint and font. 3.Truuth Liveness analyses facial features of a person during the verification process and is capable of detecting several presentation attack attempts like photo, videos, masks and deepfakes. Internship Report (Final)Page  of 6404.Truuth FaceMatch delivers a confidence score that two images are of the same person. This is used as part of the authentication protocols during onboarding or other verification event to verify that the person and their identity documents are identical. 5.Truuth FaceKey enables a user to use their face as an authentication method for online services. 6.Truuth VoiceKey enables a user to use their voice as an authentication method for online services.  7.Truuth OCR (Optical Character Recognition), which extracts data from scanned documents and provides a confidence score on the accuracy of each extracted field.  Policy of the organisation  Truuth has several policies governing it’s employees, contractors and interns. They include: 1.Information security policy  2.Acceptable Use Policy  3.Identity and Access Management standard  4.Data Classification and Handling standard  5.Logging and Monitoring standard  6.Vendor Security standard  7.Secure Development standard  8.End user computing and Teleworking standard  9.Cryptography and Key Management standard  10. Human Resource Security standard  11. API Security standard  12. Physical and Environmental Security standard 13. Infrastructure and Network Security standard  14. Patch and Vulnerability Management standard  Internship Report (Final)Page  of 740Competitors Truuth competes with other authentication solutions such as password managers and multi-biometric authentication providers. The key source of competitive advantage that Truuth maintains is Truuth BioPass. Truuth BioPass uses multiple cloud based biometrics that have direct linkage to the identity proofing of each user. This can eﬀectively deliver a higher level of confidence in the identity of the user. This level of confidence is particularly critical in high value and high risk scenarios where a false positive match of an unauthenticated user can result in severe consequences like data breach, theft or destruction. Figure 1: Truuth’s competitors In Australia, there are two main biometrics-as-a-service companies that Truuth competes with. They are Daltrey and Argus TrueID. 12 https://www.daltrey.com/1 https://www.argustrueid.com/2Internship Report (Final)Page  of 840Daltrey Daltrey (AUCYBERSCAPE, 2020) is a biometric identity provider that specialises in identity proofing and biometric authentication, i.e they oﬀer biometrics as the main method to authenticate users to access digital or physical assets.  Daltrey has two market oﬀerings: DaltreyID and Branch. DaltryID is a credential access application that uses a person’s facial features, fingerprint, voice and iris scan, and behavioural characteristics to create a biometric template that allows authentication to services and locations. Branch is a middleware platform that connects DaltreyID to exisiting access management providers like OKTA, 0Auth, etc. as well as physical access providers like Honeywell. In addition, they oﬀer four major authentication services that competes with Truuth’s products. They are: 1.User onboarding 2.Password-less authentication 3.Access Card elimination 4.Liveness detection. Argus TrueID Argus TrueID is a biometric technology company that oﬀers Biometrics-as-a-Service. They (Argus TrueID, 2018) oﬀer: 1.Access Control, to manage physical access rights, privileges and movement between zones. 2.Time and Attendance, to manage time and attendance to accurately update payroll systems. 3.Keysafe Management, a self-service biometric access and policy management of keysafe. Internship Report (Final)Page  of 9404.Visitor Management, to enrol and manage movement access to visitors. 5.Tagged Asset Management, a self-service biometric facility for managing the use and return of tagged assets. 6.Professional Services, to design and implement integrated biometric solutions. Argus TrueID’s biometric points of identification include fingerprints, iris, facial, palm vein and voice recognition.

There is also a Research and Development team that consists of a small pool of students from Macquarie University who are doing their Master’s degree and Ph.D in AI/ML focused fields. Main Offices Truuth is located at 210 Kent Street, Sydney, NSW. Comments on the organisational Structure  There is a clear organisational structure. For a fledgling company, this structure seems to be the most practical. Since there are fewer people at the very top of the organisational ladder, it becomes important to them to know the detailed day-to-day workings of the company and thus, they pay attention to the each of the teams, their members and their work product. Truuth also employs an agile approach to product development, and currently fields three lean teams focused on defining the requirements and features that need to be built for Truuth KYC, Truuth Liveness and Truuth BioPass.

I work and complete the tasks assigned to me on a weekly basis from home. My interactions with the team and the CEO is via Microsoft Teams three times a week. During these meetings, or stand-ups, I present the work that has been completed so far, the work that I plan to accomplish in the current working week, and how long the work is expected to take.  The internship began on the 1st week of the semester, i.e 25th of July, 2022 and is expected to conclude on the 13th week of the semester, i.e 6th November 2022. My internship program status is part-time. I was part of Truuth’s Liveness Research and Development (Liveness R&D) team working on the broad project ‘Automated Dataset Collection’. There was no training phase, as we were expected to start researching and learning the material on the go. Internship Report (Final)Page  of 1340Training Program Department activities Truuth Liveness analyses facial features of a person during the verification process and is capable of detecting several presentation attack attempts like photo, videos, masks and deepfakes. During the verification process, the captured image and video data is piped through a third party machine learning model to determine authenticity. This machine learning model has been trained on custom data, which includes GAN generated images. 4The Liveness R&D department wanted to set about developing its own models instead of relying on third party models.  Current status  I was assigned to the Liveness R&D team assigned to the Automated Dataset Collection project. The current situation was as follows: The liveness ML model was not performing well in real-life deployment when tested on diﬀerent users, in diﬀerent lighting conditions, and in diﬀerent scenarios. Moreover, the liveness model was not performing well in its primary task of binary classification: judging if the image was of a live person or a presentation attack. The company suspected that:  1.the training data size was not sufficient for eﬀective learning, and 2.The training labels “Live” and “Fake” were not representative of real life scenarios such as when users are in difficult lighting conditions or when a photo is used as a presentation attack. To solve this problem, the company had set about collecting their own image dataset for training purposes. When I began my internship, the company had collected 700 live and 700 fake images manually.   Generative Adversarial Networks4Internship Report (Final)Page  of 1440Business Problem It is a known fact that manual data collection is an exhaustive and expensive process, so the “Automated Dataset Collection” project was created.  The proposed idea was simple: Could we use a GAN or several GANs to inflate (or otherwise enlarge) the dataset we have already collected? This would involve not only increasing the number of facial data images but also controlling the distribution of races, ages and gender in the dataset, by conditionally augmenting the racial, age and gender distribution of the underlying dataset. This would ensure the model not only learns from a larger dataset, but also performs well on a dataset that is more representative of the overall population. Project Assigned As interns, we were tasked with:  1.researching the state of the art in GANs, and 2.their viability in our business problem,  3.conducting an associated literature review where a similar method was used to enhance the learning and performance of machine learning models, and 4.reproducing the work outlined in our chosen research paper(s) by, •Generating the training weights of the chosen GAN •Using the weights on the company dataset to enlarge the image data, and •Validating the images by a chosen metric. 5.Finally, using the enlarged dataset, we would test how well the model improves in its classification tasks. Internship Report (Final)Page  of 1540Reflective Journal Entries Week 1 In the first week of my internship, I was formally onboarded. I was asked to read and confirm that I understood the security procedures of the company. I was provided access to their AWS system, specifically the SageMaker Jupyter Notebook instances where I would be able to develop code, access the datasets and execute new notebook implementations.  I was part of the ‘liveness’ team, which consisted of Ms Le Nga Ho, Ms Jennifer Box and myself. Our supervisor was Ms Matineh Poushide. Our team was to have three standup meetings a week to make sure the work assigned to us was progressing at an acceptable pace, and to account for any delays that were anticipated. The CEO, Mr Mike Simpson would also attend most, if not all these standup meetings. The current state of the project was that the liveness ML model was not performing well in real-life deployment when tested on diﬀerent users, in diﬀerent lighting conditions, and in diﬀerent scenarios. Moreover, the liveness model was not performing well in its primary task of binary classification: judging if the image was of a live person or a presentation attack.  The liveness team suspected that either the training data size was not sufficient for eﬀective learning, or the training labels “Live” and “Fake” were not representative of real life scenarios such as when users are in difficult lighting conditions or when a photo is used as a presentation attack. To solve this problem, the company had set about collecting their own image dataset for training purposes. When I began my internship, the company had collected 700 live and 700 fake images manually.  The specifics of the project were detailed to me — my task would be to research the state of the art in GANs and examine their viability in our Internship Report (Final)Page  of 1640business problem. Afterwards we were required to conduct an associated literature review where a similar method was used to enhance the learning and performance of machine learning models when the dataset was insufficient. After the research phase, we would begin the long work of reproducing the work outlined in our chosen research paper(s) by generating the training weights of the GANs we had selected for our business problem and use them on the company’s dataset to enlarge the image data. In the next step, we would validate the images that were generated by a chosen metric to judge whether it would be acceptable to use it for model training. Finally, using the enlarged dataset, we would test how well the model improves in its classification tasks compared to the baseline accuracy performance. It was emphasised to us that this was an experimental task, and all experiments require documentation. Therefore, we were strongly encouraged to write a report about our research, experiments, and failures in the company’s Confluence page. Before the week had ended, I was deep into research papers about the state of the art GANs used today, and the more recent development in their improvement. As per instructions, I would document my work in the Confluence page. Week 2 In week 2, I continued my research on the state-of-the-art in GANs, this time focusing on the GANs that were conditional, i.e changing the facial characteristics based on age, race and gender. I also focused on GANs that focused on image quality and background. This week I was focused on writing up my findings on Confluence and in doing so, I learned a lot about the architecture of GANs and how they work.  Internship Report (Final)Page  of 1740During one of our stand up meetings, we were asked to focus on those GANs that have publicly available code and if possible, their associated weights. This was requested so as to save time training and writing code, especially if the instructions in the paper were vague or unclear. Since the literature review might be read by people who did not want to get entrenched in the technical details of various GAN architecture, I avoided technical details and focused on the approach that each author took and their respective advantage and shortcomings. I also included other details I thought were relevant so that future work on this topic would not require a further literature review about the topic of GANs. I did this work alongside Ms Ho and the two of us kept in contact about the progress of our work with regular stand up meetings where we made sure that the tasks due that week were on track.  By the end of the week, we had compiled a literature review of the GANs that we believed were the state-of-the-art and summarised their high level ideas. The final standup of the week with the team involved a summary of our work, and overview of the best performing GANs currently in literature.  I found these standup meetings helpful for a unique reason. Since the CEO was not well versed in the technical detail of GANs, I truly had to understand the concept and the diﬀerent GAN approaches in order to explain the overall high level concept in a manner that was straightforward and not convoluted or loaded with unnecessary detail. Before every stand up meeting, I would prepare what I wanted to say, and sometimes kept notes about specific GAN architectures that I wanted to draw his attention to. For his part, the CEO was very quick to catch onto the details and concepts and was always steering us to the path we were originally set on, rather than getting lost in the weeds. Internship Report (Final)Page  of 1840Week 3 In Week 3, I decided to focus on the GANs that conditionally age the facial features of a given image, while Ms Le focused on the GANs that conditionally age the racial characteristics. My supervisor, Ms Poushide, approved my work for the week and I set about cloning the public code of two age-conditional GANs that I had documented and believed to be of good quality. One of these codebases were the official work of the authors; the other was an interpretation of the paper’s instructions. Right from the start, there were a few problems I encountered. The unofficial codebase implementation of one paper had multiple instances of incorrect python syntax and linting. The official codebase of the other GAN paper was written in Tensorflow version 1, which is now depreciated. Ordinarily, running an old tensorflow version with pip and the python virtual environment, venv, would have sidestepped this issue, but the company’s AWS SageMaker instance did not support any version of tensorflow below 2.0.  I informed my supervisor of this issue, and told her that I would begin work on upgrading the official codebase from tensorflow 1.0 to tensorflow 2.0.  My work in week 3 became glacial since my attention was refocused into submitting an assignment for another unit in my coursework. However, even during this busy time, I was able to identify and collect various age-labelled facial datasets and store them on the company’s AWS instance for further processing. For this, I also wrote a small script to download the compressed datasets from their respective repositories using the GNU wget package and unzipped them for storage on the AWS instance. I also wrote a script to tag age labels to faces for one dataset that did not have explicit age labelling, rather the age information was stored as metadata on the images. The script extracted Internship Report (Final)Page  of 1940the required age information and generated a label for the respective face image. Towards the end of the week, the standup meeting with the team revealed that we did not have a standardised way to measure the quality of images generated by the GAN. I realised this was an oversight on my part, because I did not document the various image quality metrics that each GAN paper used. I promised that I would add this information to the Confluence page as soon as possible. Over the weekend, Ms Ho and I reviewed the metrics used by each paper and added the pertinent information. This actually revealed a common metric across all papers, which is the Fréchet inception Distance (FID) that measures the diﬀerence between two images. We decided that this is also the metric we should use to judge the images that we generate, and presented this recommendation during the last stand up meeting of the week. Week 4 In week 4, the liveness team had our usual standup meeting on the first day of the week. I informed the team that while I was working on refining the age-conditional GAN code, I had a new approach I wanted to propose.  I informed the team that instead of focusing on feature-specific GANs, we should instead choose one state-of-the-art GAN to enlarge the current dataset. This would ensure that the images generated would be of acceptable quality but on the other hand, there would be no improvement in the diversity of the images, i.e age, race and gender. I theorised that since the model has a certain performance rate with the current dataset, enlargement of this data with one GAN would certainly improve the performance. In my judgement, there was no evidence to suggest that the Liveness model was performing poorly due to the lack of diversity in the data, rather that the dataset was too small to begin with. I took up almost all the time in Internship Report (Final)Page  of 2040the meeting explaining how the GAN generated image was actually the ‘in-between’ of the training images, and this approach by itself would make the model learn distinct underlying features. I also stressed that conditional GANs, i.e the GANs that focus on augmenting specific facial features like race, age and gender are not known to generate truly realistic images. My concern was that these images might cause the Liveness model to learn poorly.  The team accepted my proposal with a condition — I would conduct further literature review on my proposed approach to study, document and replicate similar work that other researchers had done.  This condition was set so as to avoid ‘reinventing the wheel’. This makes sense, because the company did not want to waste my time and theirs experimenting with a new and unproven solution.  Therefore, I was asked to find a research paper (one or more) that had done similar work and only then would we use that approach to replicate the work. I proposed that we also do a proof-of-concept demonstration using my approach so that we would be able to determine if this was in fact, the correct course of action and to change track if the results were not satisfactory. The team was satisfied the progress we were making so far, and I set about finding a research paper that fit my proposed solution. During the last stand up meeting of the week, I was asked to consult on another project at Truuth — document verification. The document verification team were considering the use of GANs to augment their own training dataset and they were interested in my proposed approach. I explained the overall concept, my proposed solution to the problem we were tasked with, and promised to follow up with a written report.  I felt some personal validation that my ideas were being considered seriously and also being asked to consult with another team. I felt for the first Internship Report (Final)Page  of 2140time that I was part of a unique and cutting edge project and my (mostly) theoretical data science knowledge was being transferred over to real life projects. Week 5 Continuing on my work from last week, I had to find and summarise prior research that demonstrated that enlarging an image dataset using GANs would improve the performance of an image recognition model. Conversely, I was looking for a research paper that would demonstrate that improving the underlying racial and age distribution of the data would make a significant impact on the performance of a model than if we simply enlarged the dataset with an unconditional GAN. My research yielded answers to both questions. Image recognition models perform approximately 1% better on diversely distributed data than on imbalanced facial data. However, a few cutting-edge research papers also showed that use of StyleGAN2 to diversify the image data could also enhance learning by adding an additional training framework to generate racially distributed image classes. I compiled my research into a new Confluence page and presented my recommendations to the team and the CEO. I recommended that we should grow our dataset unconditionally with StyleGAN2 first. In parallel, we would also grow the dataset whilst controlling the distribution of the racial and age groups. The model would learn three diﬀerent instances of the data: baseline, i.e the given dataset, the enlarged data via StyleGAN2 and, the enlarged data with racial and age diverse groups. Then, we could test the model training against unseen facial data and judge their individual performance. This would allow for comparative accuracy scores to be taken and would help the company, and us, decide what approach to continue on in the Internship Report (Final)Page  of 2240future. Ms Ho and I presented this proposal jointly to the CEO and Ms Poushide, and they were satisfied with our research and recommendation.  Week 6 In week 6, I presented another potential problem I encountered during my research. GAN image generation would inevitably perform poorly when the training set was small, and our dataset, by all definitions, was small.  Even the state of the art StyleGAN2 would not generate high quality images if the starting set of images were not large enough.  This lead me to research the dataset size problem and I found two acceptable solutions. One solution was to use MIT’s Diﬀerentiable Augmentation (DiﬀAugment) optimisation method, and the other was to use NVIDIA Research's Adaptive Discriminator Augmentation (ADA). Both of these solutions claim to fix this problem and generate high quality images from small training samples.  I chose the ADA solution since NVIDIA Research is also the author of StyleGAN2, and thankfully the ADA-StyleGAN2 code and training weights were publicly available for research purposes. Thus, I proposed we use ADA-StyleGAN2 for our experiments in image generation. As usual, I proceeded to document my work in Confluence. During the weekly meetings with the CEO and the team, I outlined my work and promised that we would soon begin a trial run of the image generation. So far, neither the CEO nor Ms Poushide raised an issue about the speed of our progress. We were still in the research phase and I was anxious to start the experimental work. However, upon reflection, I realised that several hours of meaningful research saved many more hours of wasted eﬀort. For this, I am very thankful to the CEO for his constant involvement in our project to steer us to the correct path. He was not insisting that we not waste company time, but rather that we not waste our time. Internship Report (Final)Page  of 2340By the end of the week, I was finalising my literature review and preparing for the final guidelines from Ms Poushide about next steps we would take for week 7. Week 7 The team discussed potential delays in Week 7 due to university obligations like assignments, and our intention to attend an IBM sponsored hackathon, which would leave us little to no time to work on the project from the company.  We had discussed using StyleGAN2-ADA in the previous week’s discussions, and I had delegated this task to my co-worker Le Nga to perform training on our dataset. I initially planned to work on the previously mentioned conditional GAN codebases to work out the bugs and start training in parallel, but in reality, we could work on this for at most one day of the week.  Mike and Matineh were very understanding with regard to the delay and accepted that the work would have to be pushed back. As a side note, our team, which comprised of Le Nga, Jennifer, myself, and another classmate, won 2nd place at said hackathon.  Week 8 At the start of week 8, I was able to write some code for StyleGAN2-ADA and put them on our AWS instance. The next steps would involve feeding the image data into the model and perform training for up to 10 hours.  Unfortunately, before this step could be started, I contracted COVID-19 and was unable to do any work for the full duration of the week. At the same time, Le Nga contracted the flu and was also unable to work through her tasks. We notified our supervisor, and she was very accomodating and told us to take the time we needed to get better.  Internship Report (Final)Page  of 2440Towards the tail end of the week I was able to get some work done, which was to import the data contained in the AWS S3 buckets over to our SageMaker instance.  This week was very unproductive since I was unable to make any progress in image generation and I was feeling concerned about the deadlines and results we had promised. I did not know if we could even generate good results, let alone high quality images that the company could use.  Week 9 In week 9, I was able to complete the code that I had started in Week 7, i.e the code for training images using StyleGAN2-ADA. This codebase, too, was dependent on Tensorflow version 1, and AWS SageMaker does not support older Tensorflow versions. I was able to work around this issue by using diﬀerent kernels, but the GPU cluster that we were working with did not support depreciated libraries.  I conducted a private call with Matineh and Le Nga, and we attempted to work through the errors, and after an hours long meeting, we concluded that it was not feasible to use the Tensorflow version of StyleGAN2 with our environment. There was a PyTorch implementation of the same codebase, and we had no choice but to use that instead. No one on the team had experience with PyTorch, so it was up to us to learn it on the go and deal with the situation as it was.  The team agreed to implement the PyTorch version by the end of this week, and show some samples if possible by next week.  During one of our meetings, Mike brought up a problem that the Document Verification team were facing and was wondering if we had any ideas that he could take back to them. They were facing issues with blurry documents being sent by clients that were partially or totally unreadable by Internship Report (Final)Page  of 2540the OCR service. We did not have suggestions at the time but promised we would look into it and get back to him if we found a concrete solution.  Le Nga agreed to work on the PyTorch version of the codebase and I would again try to work on the conditional GANs to control the age and gender of the generated images.  Week 10 In Week 10, we made a massive leap of progress that exceeded Matineh’s expectations. She had independently trained an age-conditional GAN on a public database of images but the sample images generated were low in resolution and could not be reliably used for training purposes.  I had come across a few research papers in Week 2 that described how GANs can be used to upscale low resolution images. This technique was colloquially known as Super Resolution. I was very grateful to one of these paper’s authors who had made their training weights available publicly so we could directly perform inference. The results from inference were extremely promising.  By the end of this week I had developed a pipeline to pass images through the inferencing process, which would automatically generate a dataset of upscaled, high resolution images. This lead me to explore other publicly available training weights that we could use for inferencing directly on our other tasks, instead of reinventing the wheel.  I learned that this ML technique is called “transfer learning”, and if we had access to said weights for our desired tasks we could speed up our workflow and we would meet our deadlines before expected.  Week 11 Week 11 was extremely productive for me. Over the weekend, I was able to use the pre-trained weights of StyleGAN2 that were trained on Flickr Faces High Quality (FFHQ) dataset and apply them to the ageing task. During the presentation of my work on Monday, Matineh and Mike were extremely Internship Report (Final)Page  of 2640impressed with the outputs. The results were incredibly realistic and of such good quality that I was asked to consult with the document verification team on the feasibility of using these images for “negative training”, i.e using these samples to detect inauthentic documents that an adversarial actor might submit to our system.  I promised that I would continue to supply them with GAN generated images using the pipeline I had created for their training purposes, and that by the end of the week, I would include documentation for this work so that it could be accessible by anyone in the company.  In another two days time, I had completed the task of gender transformation using GANs using a pre-trained network of male-to-female and female-to-male weights, also generated using StyleGAN2. I was able to generate excellent results on this task as well. Mike and Matineh were similarly very pleased with these results.  The next task that we needed to complete this week was to validate the images, i.e whether certain landmarks in the background and the edges, were being preserved. This was important, since we wanted to retain background detail and information for the liveness model to discriminate presentation attacks from live persons.  This task was entirely delegated to Le Nga, who has a keen eye and is excellent at documenting her observations. Meanwhile, I was asked to re-evaluate the problem that the document verification team had, i.e blurry document photos submitted by clients that OCR was failing to read.  After another full day of experimentation with the Super Resolution GAN pipeline, I concluded that this task was not something that could be suitable handled by a GAN, but rather by more conventional Deep Learning methods. In another day, I had applied two State-of-the-Art (SOTA) deep learning solutions to solve this problem. First, using one deep learning model, I performed a retouching on these documents to correct for the low-light Internship Report (Final)Page  of 2740problem, and using a second model, I applied a de-blurring image restoration model to un-blur the text on the document.  The performance was outstanding, exceeding the wildest expectations of the document verification team. Previously, a poorly lit, blurry, license card that received a 66% confidence score by the OCR service, now received a 94.8% confidence score! These deep learning method were further adapted by me to process multiple images in a batched mode, which resulted in a rapid processing of image data.  Week 12 At the end of last week, Le Nga had completed her task of image validation and had concluded that it was completely reasonable to apply our custom models to the dataset that we wanted to inflate. We began the process of batched inferencing using a custom scheduler to process large amounts of data.  In the meantime, Mike had shared with me a paper by Microsoft Research (Bae et al., 2022), where the researchers had improved facial recognition models by retraining them on GAN augmented data, which was essentially the same task we were performing, but they had additionally performed other augmentations such as accessorising with sunglasses, change in facial pose, hair style change etc. While it is clear why this approach would improve facial recognition, I did not know if this would improve the liveness models since that was not my area of expertise. Regardless, I went about searching for a solution to a “generalised GAN augmentation”, and found a dual step solution.  First, we would generate a “direction vector” from a text prompt, for example, “a face with blonde hair” or “a face with a beard”. Then we would apply said direction vector to our chosen image with a specified strength of application. The results were quite impressive, but there were many bugs to fix in the code and since this was very close to the end of our semester, I Internship Report (Final)Page  of 2840instead decided to upload the code I had worked on thus far to the AWS SageMaker instance, and left it as a future project for the company, or for the next batch of interns.  By the end of week 12, we had also completed all the documentation requested for our GAN models, as well as detailed reproducibility instructions for anyone who wished to tinker with the code.  I had completed all tasks that I had promised to deliver to Mike and Matineh, and we had officially concluded our work at the company ahead of schedule by a full week.  Internship Report (Final)Page  of 2940Work Samples Below are some real samples that I generated with our GAN models that trained on our custom dataset. I would like to emphasise that these samples were obtained with consent in every instance for the purposes of writing this 5section.  Age Conditional GAN Figure 3: Synthetic age generation In this task, we used an image-to-image translation method that learns to encode faces into the latent space of StyleGAN2 conditionally, i.e on an ageing task. In the figure above, we applied the pre-trained layer to inference on the test image (left most image) and generated ages between 30 and 70, in 10 year increments. Gender Transformation GAN In order to make the final inflated dataset less biased in terms of gender distribution, we used a paired image-to-image translation, trained on synthetic data generated from StyleGAN2 training. This technique can be applied to any transformation on the face, but since the weights for male-to-female, and female-to-male transformation were readily available, we used this technique for gender swap purpose only.  A demonstration of this technique is given below for the male-to-female transformation using the pre-trained layers of male-to-female weights.    for this report as well as for inferencing 5Internship Report (Final)Page  of 3040Figure 4: Synthetic Male-to-Female transformation Super Resolution GAN Figure 5: Result from Super Resolution GAN  For this task, we used a Super Resolution GAN that is publicly available called GFP-GAN (Wang et al., 2021). The researchers were kind enough to 6make their pre-trained layers as well as complete code-base publicly available. I customised the code to handle multiple data in a batch processing mode. This model was used to sharpen not only blurry GAN outputs but also input images that were low resolution.  In the example above, the input image (left) has been treated with two diﬀerent random strengths of Gaussian blur, and the result image (right) is the processed image from the Super Resolution GAN.   Generative Facial Prior - GAN6Internship Report (Final)Page  of 3140Text Guided Image Generation Figure 6: Text guided image synthesis (excitement) Figure 7: Text guided image synthesis (beard) The above images are the result of an experimental code-base that I left behind for the company and future interns to improve on. This GAN manipulates images based on text guided prompts such as “a face with blonde hair”.   In the first step, we obtain a manipulation direction vector based on our text prompt and, in the second step, we apply said direction vector to our target image with a chosen “strength”, i.e how strongly the manipulation should be applied.  In the two images above, the direction vector prompt “Photo of an excited face” and “Photo of a face with a beard” have been applied to the same input image (leftmost image)  Internship Report (Final)Page  of 3240Critical Analysis My introduction to data science began with the first year unit COMP6200: Data Science, which was an introduction to the diﬀerent models used to predict and classify data, and a crash course in Anaconda which is a Python distribution for data science. In my second semester, I enrolled in Big Data and Machine Learning. It was in the latter unit I absorbed the relevant knowledge that I now use in the internship. I learned about image processing, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transfer Learning and a brief introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  In my personal time, I studied and executed various tutorials on deep learning available on Keras, PyTorch and Tensorflow, which helped me apply these concepts to the task at hand. But these are conceptual and programming related knowledge that I was able to apply to my internship.  My courses in Mining Unstructured Data and Big Data Technologies taught me an equally valuable skill: literature review and research. My first few weeks at Truuth was a lot of research into the viability of GANs as a method to augment and enlarge a dataset. Without the skill I had acquired in these two units about researching and more importantly, writing a literature review, I would have struggled to accomplish my tasks. As I continued to work through the tasks assigned to me in this internship, I have realised how complex the data is compared to the controlled, sanitised data provided in the university environment. This involves a lot of conscious eﬀort into de-noising the data since the models need to learn the true pattern of the data as opposed to the noise. This experience has made me appreciate the eﬀort and work of data scientists who work on far more complex projects than I do, such as with high resolution image, audio and video data. Internship Report (Final)Page  of 3340SWOT Analysis Strengths Truuth’s business intersects four sectors in the user authentication and identity access domain.  Figure 8: Truuth Business intersection By operating and oﬀering services at the intersection of these sectors, the company has a competitive edge in providing a “cradle-to-grave” solution for identity management and authentication for a user. Current identity providers in a given sector do not provide and meet the requirements of ISO29115 Level of Assurance (LoA4) which leaves the door open for malicious actors to impersonate users and their identity and conduct attacks against enterprises. Truuth’s BioPass solution delivers authentication with a high level of confidence which is especially important in situations where a false positive identification might have severe consequences such as access to secret documents, private medical data, high security data centres, etc. BioPass not only authenticates the user’s device but also the user. Internship Report (Final)Page  of 3440Weaknesses In my time at the company, I have realised there is room for improvement within the organisational structure and the flow of information across diﬀerent teams. These are personal observations and I believe if the company acts on the recommendations to shore up these weaknesses, there will be a tremendous improvement in collaboration and quality of the work product. The organisational structure consists of 3 lean product teams. While this type of structure makes sense for a startup, it also comes with some disadvantages. Each team has their own specialisation and they are hyper-focused on their deliverables, which are done in 2 week sprints. This has the downside of creating a siloed work culture between the teams. There is little to no collaboration across teams, and this leads to two similar problems being solved in two diﬀerent ways. For example, the Document Authentication team was investigating ways to enlarge their own dataset and did not consider the use of GANs until the CEO was briefed on my proposal in our meeting and conveyed it to them.  I consider this a weakness that should be addressed immediately since the diﬀerent products have substantial overlap in their technical goals and a more open communication across teams would lead teams to collaborate on a solution for a problem plaguing 2 or more teams. Finally, a weakness that I have observed is that not all failures in experiments are documented, although there is an eﬀort to change this across all teams. All research and experiments are otherwise documented on the company’s Confluence page. Opportunities Eﬀect of the pandemic  The COVID-19 pandemic forced almost every person in the world to work from home for 2 years. Companies that were hiring new employees had to Internship Report (Final)Page  of 3540onboard them virtually. This left many of them vulnerable to identity based attacks and had to look for third party solutions that had a high degree of confidence in identity authentication.  Even though the pandemic is reaching its tail end, hybrid and remote work options are still popular with employees and are being oﬀered by many companies. This is an opportunity for Truuth to market its KYC, BioPass and Liveness products to enterprises for seamless and secure onboarding. Safeguarding Digital Identity Passwords are the weakest link that authenticates a user to a service. Passwords are easily forgotten, guessed, brute-forced, phished, or otherwise stolen. The use of Two-factor Authentication (2FA) mitigates this somewhat but adds a layer of friction between the service and user.  An individual’s biometric points like fingerprints, iris, facial features, etc form a unique access key that is all that is needed to authenticate a user into a service. Moreover, it does not add a layer of friction and reduces cognitive load on a user to remember their passwords. This is the future of identity management and access and is a new and emerging sector with no dominant company or service in this space. Truuth’s BioPass solution not only uses biometric points as a key but also mitigates identity theft by defeating presentation attacks such as use of masks, printed or digital photo, videos and deepfakes. This is another way that Truuth is unique from its competitors in other sectors and makes it an attractive solution for enterprises to integrate in their products, services and onboarding. Threats No software is perfect and malicious actors will always find a new attack or exploit to defeat the best authentication protocols. The class of malicious Internship Report (Final)Page  of 3640actors known as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) pose a serious challenge to any authentication protocol, including the one developed by Truuth. Leveraging a nearly bottomless amount of money and resources, APTs can use any combination of security attacks to defeat biometric software. Some of them are: 1.Advanced Presentation Attack: An advanced presentation attack would use a combination of high quality masks and facial reconstruction models, GANs, and voice alteration software to impersonate a user. Fingerprint and device theft would be included as part of this attack. However, this type of attack is quite expensive since there are multi-layered biometric checks to fool. 2.Supply Chain Attack: Another route that an ATP might take is attacking the company software. By injecting malicious code to authenticate a false identity, the ATP simply has to wait for the software patch to deploy to begin bypassing the biometric checks. 3.Social Engineering Attack: This attack is not only limited to ATP capable attacks. Any malicious actor can trick a user to inadvertently authenticate themselves by misleading, straight up lying, threatening or otherwise manipulating.  Internship Report (Final)Page  of 3740Conclusion Without hesitation, I can say that my twelve weeks at Truuth have been incredibly rewarding and eye-opening. My knowledge accumulated thus far at Macquarie University has been applied onto a practical project that is quite advanced and cutting edge. As expected, real life data science projects aren’t as simple and straightforward as it is in controlled lab environments with cleaned datasets. The work on GANs is slow, complex and requires several hours of coding and debugging. The courses taught at Macquarie University aren’t designed to solve every known data science problem, rather they teach you how to think and solve new problems that you may never have encountered before. This was my experience when I was researching GANs, executing and debugging diﬀerent code bases and writing my own custom programs to suit the project.  My time here also taught me to rely on my team members instead on shouldering the work alone. Collaborating with other people opens up your perspective to new ideas and approaches.  I am very glad I was able to be a part of this project. It was my hope that by the end of the internship I will be able to contribute significantly to the improvement in the accuracy score of the liveness model. We have generated incredibly realistic training data and I fully expect that this will train the model even better.  I hope that my documentation and research will help the company transition from my work after the internship has concluded. I have documented what worked and what failed, so that more resources are not wasted. Additionally, I was happy that I was able to leave an experimental text-prompted-image-generation GAN codebase for future interns to springboard oﬀ, to generate even more quality training images.  Internship Report (Final)Page  of 3840Recommendations As noted in the Weaknesses subsection, I believe there is much to be gained by removing the silo around each team. Each team is focused on their project, and while this has its advantages in achieving the deliverables in two week sprints, the flow of information prevents access to diﬀerent solutions. For instance, two diﬀerent teams might encounter a similar problem and not be aware how the other team might be approaching it or even that they have a similar problem. Each team might implement two diﬀerent sub-optimal solutions. Since there is considerable overlap in the work product of the three teams (KYC, Liveness and BioPass), it would make sense to open up the discussion to other teams to collaborate on a more optimal solution. Not only would this foster a more collaborative work culture but since there is overlap in the work product, the teams could also work jointly in stacking the technology as required. For instance, BioPass builds upon the Liveness project and oﬀers more robust authentication checks like voice recognition. The Liveness and BioPass team could work together to create the basic (or common) authentication protocol, and then build upon the technology to advance the protocol as required. This was something that I experienced myself in Week 4, and Week 11 when I was asked to consult on the Document Verification team’s eﬀort to de-blur and retouch dark and blurry documents. As I stated in the Weaknesses subsection, I strongly believe that a more open flow of communication and cross-team collaborative problem solving would be tremendously beneficial to the company.

Introduction of the Organization  locii is a Sydney -based digital identity and data security company focused on providing the  most reliable  digital identity solution.  The company has developed  the truuth Identity Platform as a suite of integrated service s that offer the comprehensive user identity verification  from the beginning to end of  the customer lifecycle.  The truuth Identity Platform aims to mitigate the risk of identity crime by addressing inheren t weaknesses in current Know Your Customer (KYC) and authentication processes, such as reliance on insecure usernames and passwords, disconnect between KYC and ongoing authentication, and potential for fraud from deep fake and other synthetic identities. T he platform employs multiple user biometrics combined with state -of-the-art ‘liveness’ tests that significantly limit the cyber security risks. Hence, this integrated solution enables customers and enterprises to choose any combination of biometrics for online authentication, greatly improving online security while also delivering a seamless user experience.  The truuth Identity Platform  includes a number of  different biometric  modules : truuth KYC, truuth Verify, truuth Liveness, truuth FaceMatch, truuth FaceKey, truuth VoiceKey, truuth OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
