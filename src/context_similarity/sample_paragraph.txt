One of my primary goals was to create a report for the finance department and learn SQL, a skill I had yet to acquire. This project aimed to provide valuable insights to the finance team while also allowing me to expand my skill set and gain practical experience in database management. To achieve this goal, I participated in several activities, including a meeting with my supervisor to discuss the project requirements, timeline, and expectations. My supervisor provided me with guidance and support throughout the task, ensuring that I was well-equipped to deliver the report successfully and learn the necessary SQL skills. In addition to meeting with my supervisor, I attended a workshop on advanced SQL techniques, titled 'Advanced SQL II.' This workshop helped me build upon my existing data analysis skills and equipped me with the necessary knowledge to work with databases, perform complex queries, and manipulate data using SQL. After acquiring the necessary SQL skills and knowledge, I began working on the report for the finance department. I analysed the data, extracted relevant information using SQL queries, and created visualisations to highlight trends and patterns in the financial data. I then designed an interactive dashboard with multiple views, advanced filters, and parameters, providing users with a more immersive and engaging experience. Upon completing the report, I uploaded it to the Domain server, making it accessible to the relevant stakeholders within the finance department. The successful completion of this project allowed me to gain advanced SQL skills and develop a good understanding of database management. During the process, I also learned how to update databases, which further enhanced my knowledge and skills in database management. This hands-on experience in working with real-world databases not only improved my technical abilities but also gave me the confidence to tackle similar projects in the future.
