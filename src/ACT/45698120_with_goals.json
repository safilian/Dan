The concept of pre-processing data has been explored in \ndetailed and how we can do that with the help of machine learning concept, this module \ngave overview of k-nearest neighbour concept while solving real life professional problem \nhow decision tree works and what to expect from decision tree concept, how we can test \nand train our data to get required results while working efficiently, the concept of active \nlearning was being introduced too in this module while using the problem related to our \nproject concept where it\u2019s going to be an important concept to practice along with how we \ncan visualise the results of machine learning concepts. It also gives the idea of what is \nconfusion metrics and what information it gives and how we can analyse our output by \nusing that information and last, we have learned the detailed concept of random state while \nusing the data set of our project which is related to image recognition.  \nPower BI: \nThe power BI module has the learning about how we can make efficient reports of the \noutcome of our project and make interactive to get better insights of our analysis, the \npower BI is and advance tool to transforming the data, slicing the data and reporting the \ndata. We have come across the basic features of this tool like importing data, fixing the \n \n12 \ncolumn names etc. it was very interesting to get to learn this tool in real professional \nenvironment while having hands on experience with the data set of the real project.  \nIn this training program I have come across the demonstration of all the important tools \nrelated to data science technologies and get insights of how we can use, enhance, alter, and \nhow to use those tools in my project. This learning module helps me to understand the tools \nof deep learning and practice of how I can collaborate it with image recognition system how \nwe can play with the specification of our GPU and TPU to make our machine more advance, \nthe second half of this training program is based on work experience and project deliverable \nwhich is based on deep learning and machine learning concepts, natural language tool kits \nto run analysis on image of attendance system.  \n Overview of the Project:  \nThe project that I have choose is student attendance system, as we have seen since couple \nof years as everything is being online or virtual either its workshops, lectures, tutorial, \nexams or work, the attendance system seems pretty important at this point, the face \nrecognition is easy in real life but when it comes to the system it holds pretty complex \nconcept to be integrated. The image recognition is based on reading and interpreting \nthousands of pixels, layers, and differentiate the categories between the objects where we \nhave to label the data first and pre-process it before running analysis on it. this project will \nwork on academic level where we have to create a face recognition system for online \nattendance of the students, this project is the subdivision of the visual pattern recognition. \nThe face recognition should find the difference between who\u2019s face belongs in the part of \nthe data. This is the problem of power artificial intelligence and have the specifications of \nthe rough classification problem. Kjhjkhkj kjljklj  h7hh9h90h0h3dssd f3f5f9gk7b-5be4c23c/ \nThe motive of this project is to facilitate the online teaching with artificial technology and \nmake our online system more accurate and secure, it will support the teaching teams in \nonline classes and as well as work attendance but we will stick to the motive of students\u2019 \ndata only. By working on this project, we can enhance the class management and teachers \ncan be sure that the student who is present in the class does belongs to the class and limit \nthe defaulter to do the forgery in exams and attending classes. \nggYHY54c3c1f9hcg5579%$V#C9VI \nThe purpose of this project is using AI in educational departments and track the student \nattendances. By using this project, we can identify the faces of the students with the \nenrolled list so be make sure.  \nThe libraries and concept this project are based on is deep neural network and machine \nlearning concepts which we have learned in our training programs and we have practice all \nof them on related project and how we can get the idea of all these libraries in professional \nworld projects while using Python and where we have several libraries available like deep \nface and emotion recognition. Vt7v9bb8v4vw2c79vpjb6reb76fcgstHJKHK73CV43XF \nThe workflow of this project is goes like this; \nWe will provide the input images \u2192 detect \u2192 transform \u2192 crop \u2192 deep neural network  \n \n13 \nFrom this point it will goes into representation point where we have three options to work \non clustering \u2192 similarity detection and classification. It depends on to what extends we \nwill go depends on the mentor. We can run more analysis by using these libraries and make \nit vaster by running emotion recognition, object detection, classification based on what \nclasses and also it should be representational and create and API for representation of this \nproject where we can see the full potential of this application.  \nOutcome of the project:  \nPoint of the undertaking is to effectively perceive understudy in a web-based test and can \nfollow understudy's class participation. These days due to Coronavirus pandemic connection \namong understudy and educator is nearly non-existent and extremely less intelligent. So, \nwhen understudy wanted to skirt the class and attempt to hoodwink the instructor to get a \nfree participation for the class, this framework wouldn't allow them to get it done. It will \nperceive understudy face with it put away data set coordinate with understudy separate id \nand fill the participation and store it in a succeed sheet with having every one of the \nindividual subtleties of the understudy."

This journal \nhelps me to keep track of my performance in all over the period of this program. The \napproach used to write this journal is pretty informative that is called DIEP approach as \ngiven in the template, where the word \u2018D\u2019 stands for describe which hold the objective of \nwhat happened? What did I see? What did I read? What did I have heard? And so on while \nthe word \u2018I\u2019 stands for interpretation of the events which occurred during this program and \nhave detailed about new insights, my connection with other attendees presented in  this \nprogram, my feelings towards them, the team work if there\u2019s any involved, my hypothesis \nfollowed by conclusion and then we have the word \u2018E\u2019 which sums up the efficiency of what \nI have observed, my opinion regarding those observations, effectiveness of observation and \non what grounds I am making these experiences count, last but not the least we have the \nword \u2018P\u2019 which stands for planning of how this learning experience is useful in future for my \ncareer and what its serves in the long professional run and what are my recommendations.  \nAll the fellow activates and task happened under the supervision of the mentor Ivan \nBakhshayeshi and the coordinator of this program who is Jennifer Yang.  \n \n \nWEEK#07 \n \nIn the 7th week we have kick start of the project, in 1st session of the week was all about \nconsultation hour where we discussed the overview of the project and my mentor Mr. Ivan \nhas demonstrated the project\u2019s aim and purpose and importance of this deep learning \nproject in the real world.  \nWhile discussing the project outcomes, we come across that this is the very vast project and \nhas previously been worked on but still it does have so many features which can be \nintegrated with it, this session we discussed that our mentor has also worked in this kind of \nproject in his professional life and how hard it is to work with big data in cooperation with \nthis kind of application.  \nOur mentor has also discussed what are the protocols to work on this project where we \ncome across that from now on after easter break we will have two session per week same \nas past but in the first session we will assign the task related to the project and in the \nsecond session we all have present our work to the mentor.  \nIn this meeting we have also discussed the related problems regarding this project and \neveryone has a say who related to the data science background what we have achieve in \nour university times and what deep learning projects we have worked with on academic \nlevel and in the end, we have been assigned to study related or similar problems of face \nrecognition systems and how deep we can go and what challenges we can face while \nworking on this application. The enthusiasm and support from the mentor were pretty high \nwhich gives me motivation to do better.  \nIn the 2nd session we discussed the related problems and challenges which needs to \novercome while working on this project. The libraries we have explored related to face \nrecognition system been discussed to and to what extend we should take this project been \n \n15 \nhighlighted too. In the end, we got our rescheduled for the upcoming sessions and how we \nwill proceed with these in future after easter break.  \nIn conclusion, so we have great learning environment provided by ITIC team and all our \nqueries has been entertained from both our mentor and Ms. Jennifer. \n \n \nThis reflective journal holds the detailed events\u2019 entries till week#7 as we will go forward \nthere\u2019s going to be new findings, observations and learning experiences will come by time. \nThe project has been kicked in from the last week and as by mentor there\u2019s going be one \nsession per week which will be reserved for consultation and the other one would use for \npresentation of the work we will perform and keeping in loop with Mr. Ivan would help me \nto get better learning outcomes out of this program, so far this is what I have observed, He \nalso mentioned that in consulting session we all will be provided with different task which \nwe need to practice and present in the second session and these meetings would be really \nprofessional where you have to come up with different ideas and professional mindset \nalong with the research work home work so you can answer all the related queries of the \nattendees.  \n \nWEEK#08 \n \nThe 8th week is started with project initialization.  \nThis week, we have discussed about the objective of the project, where our mentor \nexplained what we are going to working on, which is going to be a student attendance \nsystem by using face recognition method. This project will be able to detect the faces of the \nstudent through live camera which helps the teachers to mark student attendance in online \nclasses. To start working on this project first we need background knowledge of the \nobjective and the available packages, so Mr. Ivan has shared quite good knowledge and \nmaterial of how these application works and their specifications.  \nWe have been assigned the task to start creating database by using TensorFlow data \naugmentation technique and explore all the related like image data generator and create \nand data base to start working, we all have to create a database of at least 20 images by \nusing keras data augmentation techniques and shared it around so we can go further from \nthere.  \nTo learn and explore about this project is an interesting part and working with the \nprofessional mentor helping me to clear my theories which I was shy enough to ask in my \nclass.  \n \n \n \n \n16 \nWEEK#09 \nThe 9th week is started working on the project.  \nThis week, we have discussed about the how to create the database for the project, our \nMentor has shown us how it needs to be done share some resources for the reference as \nwell, we have started making database that consists of images of the student, we are all \nadvised to share our databases with each other so we can test our model and get better and \naccurate results.  \nThe database should be created by using python library CV2 which will access your live \ncamera take snapshot which should be uploaded on some medium to be shared across the \nmates, so far, we are successful to create our individual datasets now we need to use keras \ndata augmentation techniques to train our data and get the results. In the first meeting we \nhave presented our datasets and discussed the issues facing while creating them.  \nWe have been assigned the task to start working with the database by using TensorFlow \ndata augmentation technique and do data augmentation by using keras libraries and \nexplore all its face recognition related tools.  \n \nWEEK#10 \nThe 10th week is making progress on the project.  \nThis week, we have presented our initial work to our mentor which is created databases, \nthis week while working on project I have explored CV2 libraries which use to classifier as \ndata collected before that was not very much productive so I am improving my data \ncollection process for which I have explored CV2 frontal face classifier and capture 100 more \npictures so we can have more data to work with, As presented to Mr. Ivan we have \ndiscussed that this is an good approach for collection of data. The next step is augmentation \nof keras, I have explored few keras applications like VGG16 for classification of data by using \nVGG16 I have so far successful to train my model which is giving me quite good accuracy but \nit needs to be mitigated as I believe my model is overfitting on my current data while \ndiscussing these points to our mentor, we have tried few things and he suggested to try \nsome other application of kera which are imageDataGenerator and, etc.  \nWe have assigned to go on the next step which is recognition as far we are quite on track \nand on timeline with the project meanwhile, I am trying to work on how to use facenet and \nother application available for that I am going through some research and making good use \nof papers available regarding face recognition.  \n \n \n \n \n17 \nWEEK#11 \n \nThe 11\nth week is resolving discrepancies in the project.  \nThis week, we have discussed about the challenges we are getting while working on the \nproject, in the first session of this week we have presented the updates on your projects \nwhich was the one step up in the work of face recognition. I have successfully trained few \nmodels over my data but also while discussing the issues facing, I have found out that I need \nto try to use different approach and our mentor has shown us few different libraries which \nare available and would be much easier to resolve the accuracy issues I am facing while \nworking on the environment. In the second session we have discussed the market of data \nscience industry and quite few insights of what and how we all can get ready ourselves for \nthe coming chapter of our lives and also while discussing on project we have resolved some \nimportant issues related to CV2 libraries, also to go forward we have been assigned a task to \ntry use face recognition library which has C++ features and how we can integrate it with our \nproject to get better results and mark attendance in csv file.  \nSo far, we have done augmentation which is the labelling of the data, then we have done \nthe classification which is comparing and telling us which class the data belongs too now we \nare working on the marking the attendance by comparing the face from webcam and mark \nthe personnel attendance in the csv file.  \nWEEK#12 \n \nThe 12th week is discussing the new findings and work environment.  \n \nIn the first session we have discussed the issues we are facing in the project by using face \nrecognition library of python which is already been build and to incorporate it with our \nenvironment I was getting few errors which I have discussed with the mentor and we found \na better solution regarding that issue, in this meeting everyone has discussed what they \nhave learned so far and how it\u2019s helping them to get done this project and for the next \nsession we have been asked to have a presentation to show what we have done so far on \nthe project and present it as our final presentation of this internship.  \n \nIn the second session we have been asked to present our project in form of presentation, I \nhave presented my project in PPT and so far, get succussed to achieve the objective of the \nproject.  \nThis was our last session as an internee and we exchange feedback of the program overall \nand Mr. Ivan gave us few tips on how we can make our resume better and how to get \nprepared for the interviews and what resources we can use for job application."

            "text": "CRITICAL ANALYSIS \n \nThe critical analysis over this internship program and how it has been benefiting me to \nexpand my knowledge and get idea of professional world of data science industry. This \ninternship helps me to find my career path and get the idea of professional world and \nworking under professional data scientist mentor was the experience to get hands on \nexperience of all the theoretical work in professional environment.  \nBy getting this opportunity I have come across to well written papers of projects related to \ndeep learning and machine learning and how we can label data and tools available like \nRobocop which I have never experience before this program.  \n \nThis program has made me realise there\u2019s not only one right answer exist for a problem. \nHowever, it depends on how you are analysing the problem to get the insight of the data \nand while working with big data set what challenges we can face and how to tackle them \nwith efficient solutions. There are many research documents available and data science is \nbecoming the vast community with time where you can ask and discussion related issues \nyou are facing while working on any kind of project.  Jkhkjhkj bbjkbk kbkjbjkbjkbjbjbk jbkkbk  \n \nThe theoretical knowledge I have learned during this degree was the basic of the data \nscience and to practice those in professional light is what makes me get better insight of \nthose complex concepts where I have discovered they are quite interesting and easy to \npractice and by working with ITIC  I have explored new ways to see the problem and where \nto look for its solution which always been an hustle for me, while working with ITIC I have \nlearned the ways of communicating, presenting, how to make work relations, how to \ndifferentiate between professional roles and how reporting hierarchy works, which was \nnever clear before. Ghjghjh nlk srttr cfchg bds456 89nhg 24sdx ,ll988 ctxs54676 \u2018.;;.778 bhh \n \nAs a case for my temporary position project expresses a totally different thought and an \nexcursion to leave on, so any old strategies or help are not useful in handling those \ncircumstances. So, I have accompanied a genuinely new thing to build my critical thinking \ncapacities and work efficiency. I have concentrated on research papers, utilized a current \ndataset yet my undertaking has its own new difficulties and arrangements.  \n \nFurthermore, the hands-on experience of new tools like tableau, Robocop, google collab is \nmake this program worth a while, as I am more incline towards visualisation of data and \nreporting part of the analysis and how to control the specification of GPU and TPU was \nsomething which I have never come across before this program. The managing of \ncomputational layers and actually managing them in practice is way different than \ntheoretical concepts, while working with python on anaconda and making our project looks \npresentable is an integral part of work in our professional life. The explanation of analysis \nand making them understand while using interactive tools caught my attention and there \nare number of new tools available which are enhancing every day.  \n \nThe part of data visualisation in theory was based on basics of what suitable graphs we can \nuse but while working with ITIC and this program helps me explore more and better options \nlike 3D graphs, interactive reporting tools, which graphs is suitable with what type of \nanalysis and how we can make them visual and understandable.  \n \n22 \nThe session of pre-processing data which I have learned in theoretically before and had a \nsurface level knowledge about it with small data set but while practicing pre-processing of \ndata in professional world and handling of big data is the thing which I always wanted to \nlearn and this program met my expectation regarding that. I have learned how and to what \nextend we need to pre-process our data set before running analysis on it. It gave me the \nidea that we have to limit our pre-processing of data set otherwise it can interfere with the \noutcomes and what basic procedure needs to be in mind while pre-processing of the data. \nWhen it comes to work with neural network what procedures we need to take and how \nlabelling of our data can help to what extent.  \n \nThe optimisation of model accuracy was the concept of machine learning which I have \npractice in theoretically but applying that concept on real application helps me to \nunderstand it\u2019s specification better and what and how to design the model while not \ndeviating from the problem was a challenging part for me learn and practice but this \nprogram and under the supervision of my mentor I have learned how we can select better \nmodel and how can optimize their accuracy with big data sets, the concept of epochs was \nbeen taught in the university but to insight of that I have learned in this training program \nand how we can select the number of epochs required for current type of computation.  \n \nThe ITIC education is a complete and professional organisation based on their working \nprojects and partners of this organisation we have the idea what standard I am going to \nlearn about the professional environment, the mentor I am working under is quite \nthoughtful who share his experiences every now and then which gives me idea of working in \nthe data science industry and what roles of data scientist holds. They have provided us \nlearning environment without any judgments and my mentor always appreciate the idea of \nparticipation in the session. While reviewing the training program he is enlighten us all the \ncomplex concepts of data science in easiest way possible which was remarkable. In this past \ncouple of weeks, we have many discussions about professional life and career counselling \nand which path I fit better to pursue in the future, on the other hand, Ms. Jennifer always \nactive in all the session along with Mr. Ivan to take closer look of how this program is going \nand she always welcome suggestions if there\u2019s any room for improvement. The overall \nexperience so far is worth it and I would say the ITIC is providing the bridge between \nuniversity to real professional world which is really helpful especially for the international \nstudents like me.  Dftio bdsru 6799 bgcf646 4323424 09880 bgvhg 2334 zsz nkjjk7688 fdgf  \n \nI would like to sum up my analysis by adding that, this program helps me to expand my \nthinking process and motived me to think outside of the box and come up with possible \nsolution rather just making sure to get the answer right as this is the learning environment \nwhere all types of wrongs are welcome to so we can discuss and get the better results, this \nprogram also helping me to learn team work and resource management as by learning \nunder Mr. Ivan it\u2019s quite fun and the experience with ITIC is overall remarkable."

Furthermore, I would like to highlight the interface of their website which could \nbe improve as being a tech company they should improve the interface of their website as \nit\u2019s not very appealing to me and it does need an update. When we talk about their training \nprogram as I have come across it could get more better by adding some more advance \nlearning and if they can provide more material regarding their live project, it can help \nstudents to learn more expand their skills. Their Linked in profile seems old which needs \nnew update and should work on it as being an freshie student to check the standard of the \norganisation, the first thing we look into its organization\u2019s LinkedIn profile. I believe these \nare small issues of weakness which needs to be considered to uplift the busines and \nstandard of their organisation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n24 \nOpportunities:  \n \nITIC global as many big names partner under their belt and the deliverable products they are \nworking with has vast concept in upcoming times like cloud services, networking, cyber \nsecurity, The ITIC is providing great opportunities to the new students of background of data \nscience, cyber security and network engineers as well as it also providing the research \ncentre for artificial intelligence which is remarkable and giving hands on experience of \nworking on Telstra product and services for the students its big opportunity to grab in this \ncrucial times where pandemic has given us big hit in all regards to have the opportunity to \nexplore all these learning from the university was quite a challenge due to past \ncircumstances while ITIC has taken the lead in that learning department and providing the \nchance to learn in professional environment will open new gates of opportunities for the \nstudents. The career consulting you get while getting their training program it should be \nhighlighted here as it\u2019s not an easy thing to get in real world. ITIC is doing an great job of \ncreating opportunities in all big tech fields which is going to change the world and having \nexperience to learn on cisco technologies for networking students is a great way of \nexperiencing their theoretical concepts.  \n \nThreats:  \n \nAs technology industry is very vast and expanding everyday so there\u2019s competition for every \norganization exist in this industry and being in market you need to be insightful of all the \nnew products and business strategies introducing every day and night, ITIC does have threat \nwith few companies which could be challenging in coming time but I believe this \norganization is going in right way, there\u2019s always a chance to improve and get better so It \nwon\u2019t be hard to say that ITIC should get working with more partners on board and should \nintroduce more products and services in the marketing to beat their competitors. There are \nnot many organizations out their which can move ITIC capacities to set out really \ncollaborating open doors and venture. A portion of the organizations have profoundly \ncapable individuals at their scratch. Additionally, assuming that every one of the tasks are \nbegins all the while at the firm it is difficult to adapt to the undertaking cut off times."
