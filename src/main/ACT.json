It will engage you \nwith the abilities and useful information to venture into the universe of Data Science, \nMachine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. ITIC is a main defender in creating Data Science \nin Australia with driving associations with both industry and examination. As mentioned \nearlier this program has two modules one is training module other is work experience so in \nthe training program which held first five weeks of this program has learning of basic to \nadvance learning of all the important Data science tools, and programming languages which \nare useful in data science industry.  \nFurthermore, this training program is been designed to polish data analytics tools, \nvisualization of data, data pre-processing, data presentation and working with real-life \nproblem-solving techniques. The first five weeks or the first half of this program we have \ndiscovered and work with six different tools of data analytics which are as follow;  \nPython:  \nWe have learned basic to advance level of python libraries, how and what tools needed to \nwork with python language, I have discovered various data types of python language while \npracticing on jupyter notebook and some python functions like making linear modelling, \ndata pre-processing, pandas, NumPy and matplotlib for data visualization. We have been \nprovided few resources material as well to get better and full insight of python language. In \nthis module we have also discovered why python language is better option to work with \ndata analysis because of its vast libraries support and how we can choose better and \ncompatible libraries depending on our desired outcomes and project specifications.  \nSQL:  \nAs being an data science student, I have an idea of importance of sequential query \nlanguage, in this module I have come across how we can handle structural data bases and \nnon-structural data bases, how we can use cloud data bases and their specifications, \nfunctions and data types of SQL, by which technique we can write efficient queries, \nconnection of SQL data bases with python, how we can compare the scalability of non-\nstructural and structural data bases and quite vast hands on experience of MongoDB and \ntheir specification.  \nTableau: \nThis tool was pretty new to me, I haven\u2019t come across this tool before this program which \nwas quite an experience for me to learn this interesting tool was best part of this training \nprogram, In Tableau we have discovered its fundamental specification, how we can get \nbetter insight of our data set, how to do better visualization of our data by using tool. The \ntableau is an easy and powerful tool for data analytics and the interaction live data graphs \nwhich is better to understand and best to deliver our outcomes.

It will engage you \nwith the abilities and useful information to venture into the universe of Data Science, \nMachine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. ITIC is a main defender in creating Data Science \nin Australia with driving associations with both industry and examination. As mentioned \nearlier this program has two modules one is training module other is work experience so in \nthe training program which held first five weeks of this program has learning of basic to \nadvance learning of all the important Data science tools, and programming languages which \nare useful in data science industry.  \nFurthermore, this training program is been designed to polish data analytics tools, \nvisualization of data, data pre-processing, data presentation and working with real-life \nproblem-solving techniques. The first five weeks or the first half of this program we have \ndiscovered and work with six different tools of data analytics which are as follow;  \nPython:  \nWe have learned basic to advance level of python libraries, how and what tools needed to \nwork with python language, I have discovered various data types of python language while \npracticing on jupyter notebook and some python functions like making linear modelling, \ndata pre-processing, pandas, NumPy and matplotlib for data visualization. We have been \nprovided few resources material as well to get better and full insight of python language. In \nthis module we have also discovered why python language is better option to work with \ndata analysis because of its vast libraries support and how we can choose better and \ncompatible libraries depending on our desired outcomes and project specifications.  \nSQL:  \nAs being an data science student, I have an idea of importance of sequential query \nlanguage, in this module I have come across how we can handle structural data bases and \nnon-structural data bases, how we can use cloud data bases and their specifications, \nfunctions and data types of SQL, by which technique we can write efficient queries, \nconnection of SQL data bases with python, how we can compare the scalability of non-\nstructural and structural data bases and quite vast hands on experience of MongoDB and \ntheir specification.  \nTableau: \nThis tool was pretty new to me, I haven\u2019t come across this tool before this program which \nwas quite an experience for me to learn this interesting tool was best part of this training \nprogram, In Tableau we have discovered its fundamental specification, how we can get \nbetter insight of our data set, how to do better visualization of our data by using tool. The \ntableau is an easy and powerful tool for data analytics and the interaction live data graphs \nwhich is better to understand and best to deliver our outcomes. In this program we can \nhands on experience of tableau, exploration of its basic features as well as advance \n \n11 \nspecification.

            "text": "REFLECTIVE JOURNAL ENTRIES \n \nThe reflective journal has the information of all the weeks till now which are one to sixth \nweek so far, it includes all the detailed discussion of the activities which are carried forward \nin this program and the detailed description of the task has been assigned and learning \nobjectives which has been delivered so far from the organization and mentor. This journal \nhelps me to keep track of my performance in all over the period of this program. The \napproach used to write this journal is pretty informative that is called DIEP approach as \ngiven in the template, where the word \u2018D\u2019 stands for describe which hold the objective of \nwhat happened? What did I see? What did I read? What did I have heard? And so on while \nthe word \u2018I\u2019 stands for interpretation of the events which occurred during this program and \nhave detailed about new insights, my connection with other attendees presented in  this \nprogram, my feelings towards them, the team work if there\u2019s any involved, my hypothesis \nfollowed by conclusion and then we have the word \u2018E\u2019 which sums up the efficiency of what \nI have observed, my opinion regarding those observations, effectiveness of observation and \non what grounds I am making these experiences count, last but not the least we have the \nword \u2018P\u2019 which stands for planning of how this learning experience is useful in future for my \ncareer and what its serves in the long professional run and what are my recommendations.  \nAll the fellow activates and task happened under the supervision of the mentor Ivan \nBakhshayeshi and the coordinator of this program who is Jennifer Yang.  \n \n \nWEEK#07 \n \nIn the 7th week we have kick start of the project, in 1st session of the week was all about \nconsultation hour where we discussed the overview of the project and my mentor Mr. Ivan \nhas demonstrated the project\u2019s aim and purpose and importance of this deep learning \nproject in the real world.  \nWhile discussing the project outcomes, we come across that this is the very vast project and \nhas previously been worked on but still it does have so many features which can be \nintegrated with it, this session we discussed that our mentor has also worked in this kind of \nproject in his professional life and how hard it is to work with big data in cooperation with \nthis kind of application.  \nOur mentor has also discussed what are the protocols to work on this project where we \ncome across that from now on after easter break we will have two session per week same \nas past but in the first session we will assign the task related to the project and in the \nsecond session we all have present our work to the mentor.  \nIn this meeting we have also discussed the related problems regarding this project and \neveryone has a say who related to the data science background what we have achieve in \nour university times and what deep learning projects we have worked with on academic \nlevel and in the end, we have been assigned to study related or similar problems of face \nrecognition systems and how deep we can go and what challenges we can face while \nworking on this application. The enthusiasm and support from the mentor were pretty high \nwhich gives me motivation to do better.  \nIn the 2nd session we discussed the related problems and challenges which needs to \novercome while working on this project. The libraries we have explored related to face \nrecognition system been discussed to and to what extend we should take this project been \n \n15 \nhighlighted too. In the end, we got our rescheduled for the upcoming sessions and how we \nwill proceed with these in future after easter break.  \nIn conclusion, so we have great learning environment provided by ITIC team and all our \nqueries has been entertained from both our mentor and Ms. Jennifer. \n \n \nThis reflective journal holds the detailed events\u2019 entries till week#7 as we will go forward \nthere\u2019s going to be new findings, observations and learning experiences will come by time. \nThe project has been kicked in from the last week and as by mentor there\u2019s going be one \nsession per week which will be reserved for consultation and the other one would use for \npresentation of the work we will perform and keeping in loop with Mr. Ivan would help me \nto get better learning outcomes out of this program, so far this is what I have observed, He \nalso mentioned that in consulting session we all will be provided with different task which \nwe need to practice and present in the second session and these meetings would be really \nprofessional where you have to come up with different ideas and professional mindset \nalong with the research work home work so you can answer all the related queries of the \nattendees.  \n \nWEEK#08 \n \nThe 8th week is started with project initialization.  \nThis week, we have discussed about the objective of the project, where our mentor \nexplained what we are going to working on, which is going to be a student attendance \nsystem by using face recognition method. This project will be able to detect the faces of the \nstudent through live camera which helps the teachers to mark student attendance in online \nclasses. To start working on this project first we need background knowledge of the \nobjective and the available packages, so Mr. Ivan has shared quite good knowledge and \nmaterial of how these application works and their specifications.  \nWe have been assigned the task to start creating database by using TensorFlow data \naugmentation technique and explore all the related like image data generator and create \nand data base to start working, we all have to create a database of at least 20 images by \nusing keras data augmentation techniques and shared it around so we can go further from \nthere.  \nTo learn and explore about this project is an interesting part and working with the \nprofessional mentor helping me to clear my theories which I was shy enough to ask in my \nclass.  \n \n \n \n \n16 \nWEEK#09 \nThe 9th week is started working on the project.  \nThis week, we have discussed about the how to create the database for the project, our \nMentor has shown us how it needs to be done share some resources for the reference as \nwell, we have started making database that consists of images of the student, we are all \nadvised to share our databases with each other so we can test our model and get better and \naccurate results.  \nThe database should be created by using python library CV2 which will access your live \ncamera take snapshot which should be uploaded on some medium to be shared across the \nmates, so far, we are successful to create our individual datasets now we need to use keras \ndata augmentation techniques to train our data and get the results.
