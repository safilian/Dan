There were multiple aspects that were covered throughout this week such as- the potential signs of compromise in a network, the process of network monitoring to identify the indicator of compromise, the process of gathering the evidence and also the process of extracting some valuable leads from that evidence that can help in solving the digital forensic case. Along with that, there are numerous war rooms scenarios designed for students, each focusing on a particular subject such as network analysis, forensics analysis, Linux foundations, system analysis, scripting, and PowerShell basics. I concentrated on Battle Room 9 this week. The main goal of this week’s internship were:  To understand the basics of the Indicators of Compromise in a cyber-incident, On Friday, I gave a talk about one of the tasks I accomplished in battle room 9, finding the laptop's registered owner. To inspect registry hives, I used Registry Explorer, an open-source program. I used the local workstation of Steve Laptop to load the SYSTEM register hive and to learn about the procedure to identify the IOCs, the criteria of its identification and also the process of its verification. The learning of activities and the fulfillment of these goals gave the following outcomes after the end of this week: At the end of this week, I was aware of the basic concept of the IOCs in a forensic process which includes unusual outbound network traffic, sales in the database read volume, mismatched port application traffic etc. which are also considered as the potential signs of IOCs, the process of identifying these IOC are also learnt and I was able to identify these IOCs after the completion of this week The life cycle includes- gathering data from the initial leads, create or edit the IOCs which includes verification of the IOCs and then the final step is to publish the IOCs (Domingues et al., 2023) and I finished quizzes on the danger landscape and creating a successful reaction strategy on our ITIC LMS platform.\",\n",

    "    \"During the seventh week of the internship program, I became familiar with the indicators of Compromise (IOC) in a digital forensic process and what role does it plays in the investigation process. There were multiple aspects that were covered throughout this week such as- the potential signs of compromise in a network, the process of network monitoring to identify the indicator of compromise, the process of gathering the evidence and also the process of extracting some valuable leads from that evidence that can help in solving the digital forensic case. Along with that, there are numerous war rooms scenarios designed for students, each focusing on a particular subject such as network analysis, forensics analysis, Linux foundations, system analysis, scripting, and PowerShell basics. I concentrated on Battle Room 9 this week. The main goal of this week’s internship were:  To understand the basics of the Indicators of Compromise in a cyber-incident, On Friday, I gave a talk about one of the tasks I accomplished in battle room 9, finding the laptop's registered owner. To inspect registry hives, I used Registry Explorer, an open-source program. I used the local workstation of Steve Laptop to load the SYSTEM register hive and to learn about the procedure to identify the IOCs, the criteria of its identification and also the process of its verification. The learning of activities and the fulfillment of these goals gave the following outcomes after the end of this week: At the end of this week, I was aware of the basic concept of the IOCs in a forensic process which includes unusual outbound network traffic, sales in the database read volume, mismatched port application traffic etc. which are also considered as the potential signs of IOCs, the process of identifying these IOC are also learnt and I was able to identify these IOCs after the completion of this week The life cycle includes- gathering data from the initial leads, create or edit the IOCs which includes verification of the IOCs and then the final step is to publish the IOCs (Domingues et al., 2023) and I finished quizzes on the danger landscape and creating a successful reaction strategy on our ITIC LMS platform.\",\n",

      "{\"One of my primary goals was to create a report for the finance department and learn SQL, a skill I had yet to acquire. This project aimed to provide valuable insights to the finance team while also allowing me to expand my skill set and gain practical experience in database management. To achieve this goal, I participated in several activities, including a meeting with my supervisor to discuss the project requirements, timeline, and expectations. My supervisor provided me with guidance and support throughout the task, ensuring that I was well-equipped to deliver the report successfully and learn the necessary SQL skills. In addition to meeting with my supervisor, I attended a workshop on advanced SQL techniques, titled 'Advanced SQL II.' This workshop helped me build upon my existing data analysis skills and equipped me with the necessary knowledge to work with databases, perform complex queries, and manipulate data using SQL. After acquiring the necessary SQL skills and knowledge, I began working on the report for the finance department. I analysed the data, extracted relevant information using SQL queries, and created visualisations to highlight trends and patterns in the financial data. I then designed an interactive dashboard with multiple views, advanced filters, and parameters, providing users with a more immersive and engaging experience. Upon completing the report, I uploaded it to the Domain server, making it accessible to the relevant stakeholders within the finance department. The successful completion of this project allowed me to gain advanced SQL skills and develop a good understanding of database management. During the process, I also learned how to update databases, which further enhanced my knowledge and skills in database management. This hands-on experience in working with real-world databases not only improved my technical abilities but also gave me the confidence to tackle similar projects in the future.\": 38, 'I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Suyash, Gilmar, Phuong, Hieu, and Ahmad from Domain Group Australia for their invaluable help and guidance during the past 7 weeks.
